# README.md

Use README.md to give brief instructions to other developers on what your repo contains and how to use the contents.

For the coursework it is useful to provide:

- setup instructions if it requires more than `pip install -e .` to set up your code
- the line of code to run your app so the marker can copy and paste into a terminal
